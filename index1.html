        <p class="styles"><b>Paris</b>, city and capital of France, situated in the north-central part of the country. 
        People were living on the site of the present-day city, located along the Seine River some has
        233 miles upstream from the river’s mouth on the English Channel (La Manche),by about 7600 BCE. The modern city has spread 
        from the island and far beyond both banks of the Seine.

        <h2>CHARACTER OF THE CITY</h2>
        <p class="styles">For centuries Paris has been one of the world’s most important and attractive cities. 
        It is appreciated for the opportunities it offers for business and commerce, for study,for culture, and for entertainment; its gastronomy, haute couture, painting, literature, 
        and intellectual community especially enjoy an enviable reputation.Its sobriquet “the City of Light” earned during the Enlightenment, 
        remains appropriate, for Paris has retained its importance as a centre for education and intellectual pursuits.
        </p>
        <h2>HISTORY</h2>
        <p class="styles">In its centuries of growth Paris has for the most part retained the 
        circular shape of the early city. Its boundaries have spread outward to engulfthe surrounding towns (bourgs), usually built around monasteries or churches 
        and often the site of a market. From the mid-14th to the mid-16th century, the city’s growth was mainly eastward; since then it has been westward. 
        It comprises 20 arrondissements (municipal districts), each of which has its own mayor, town hall, and particular features. The numbering begins in the heart 
        of Paris and continues in the spiraling shape of a snail shell, ending to the far east.Parisians refer to the arrondissements by number as the first (premier), second (deuxième), third (troisième), and so on. Adaptation to the problems of urbanization—such as immigration, 
        housing, social infrastructure, public utilities, suburban development,and zoning—has produced the vast urban agglomeration.
        </p>
        <h2>CLIMATE</h2>
        <p class="styles">Paris has a typical Western European oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb, although a bit more extreme, is still a typical climate of the 
        category) which is affected by the North Atlantic Current. The overall climate throughout the year is mild and moderately wet.
        Summer days are usually warm and pleasant with average temperatures between 15 and 25 °C(59 and 77 °F), and a fair amount of sunshine. Each year, however, there are a few days when the temperature rises above 32 °C (90 °F).
        Longer periods of more intense heat sometimes occur, such as the heat wave of 2003 when temperatures exceeded 30 °C (86 °F) for weeks, reached 40 °C (104 °F) on some days and 
        seldom cooled down at night.
